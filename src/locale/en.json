This preliminary work is necessary before diving into Bitcoin programming. When we feel ready we will start exploring the Bitcoin Core API and learn interacting with a Bitcoin full node.",

We will use the <1>extensive BitcoinJS guide made by Bitcoin Studio</1> to learn how to compose various type of transactions. We will first create different Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PKH) transactions used to pay one or multiple persons. We will then construct more advanced transactions of type Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2SH) which consists on composing an arbitrary smart-contract and locking funds to it, redeemable under specific conditions such as hashlocks, timelocks and signatures. We will start by a simple algebraic puzzle, to continue with timelocks, cryptographic puzzles, multi-signatures and scripts that are mixing all of this. Last but not least, we will anchor data on the blockchain using the special OP_RETURN operator, which has multiple use cases like notarizing documents.",

    "hero": "Bitcoin Studio has been founded by Stéphane Roche, Bitcoin and web developer, educator, consultant, maker and convinced cypherpunk.",
    "about-title": "Stéphane Roche - Founder",
    "about-content-1": "Short answer: I consider myself as an intermediate Javascript/Typescript Fullstack developer, with a solid knowledge of Bitcoin, blockchain technology and related topics. In March 2019 I founded the company Bitcoin Studio to offer Bitcoin software development and trainings. Over the years I think I gained enough experience to have the capacity to meet your needs.",
    "about-content-2": "Long answser: When I heard about Bitcoin in 2014, I quickly became obsessed. An alternative to the financial system was very appealing to me and I wanted to know more. I entered the rabbit hole and it completely changed my life. A year and half before I was receiving my Master degree of History/Audiovisual documentalist. But I was already in love with Computer Science and just after the degree I was following evening courses to learn web development. That was the first bold move. It was not a comfortable situation but more a “succeed or die” situation, going back to the parental home at 28. Then for my end of web-dev studies internship in 2015 I applied to the French company Ledger and had the priviledge to work six months with a small and talented team where I learned a lot about Bitcoin and programming.",
    "about-content-3": "After which I worked a year as a Javascript developer in a fast growing startup called Anaplan, situated in the most exclusive district of Paris (16th arrondissement). It was a valuable experience, but end of 2016 I decided to go back to crypto-currencies. I could see the potential of blockchain technology when nobody around me knew a single thing about it. However, at the time I thought that focusing on Ethereum was the obvious choice in terms of business. I learnt how to create smart-contracts with Solidity, getting involved in different projects, co-founding Asseth, a now big non-profit association that promotes Ethereum in various ways. I was at the forefront, learning, programming and teaching Ethereum when it was still very early stage and unknown from the vast population.",
    "about-content-4": "The problem is that I couldn't find in Ethereum the values I was fighting for. I had a good position in the nascent industry, renowned in the small Ethereum French community that we created from the ground up. It was incomprehensible for everybody when I left Ethereum, right in the middle of the ICO craze. Yet another very bold move, that I don’t regret.",
    "about-content-5": "In September 2017 I moved to Lisbon to join a new crypto-friendly coworking space called The Block founded by a few French guys (including Kevin Loaec which organise Breaking Bitcoin and Building on Bitcoin), and I started to focus exclusively on Bitcoin. During two years I learned Bitcoin very thouroughly, studying all the different aspects of the technology and associated subjects like cryptography and game theory. I set myself the goal of doing Bitcoin technical presentations at the coworking every two months. The slides of each presentation is on my website.",
    "about-content-6": "During this time I made various educational projects, which was a very effective way for me to learn. I made an extensive guide that explains how to create all the different type of transaction with BitcoinJS, a virtual machine builder that includes all the Bitcoin softwares, a mnemonic template, a sort of game to teach how Bitcoin transaction works, etc. Everything is on the website and github. My last project is a Nespresso capsule vending machine that takes Bitcoin over Lightning Network. The machine has been made in a FabLab with a laser cutter and a 3D printer. It was the occasion to learn CAD, SBC programming with Lua, etc. Regarding the user interface, it comes in two versions. Customers can pay through a web application that I made, or through a BTCPay Point-of-Sale application. The machine is now in operation at The Block coworking."
