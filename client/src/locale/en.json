        "p2": "We will install a real Bitcoin wallet, which will be an opportunity to learn to store digital assets in a secure way. You will not only learn how to create a backup as well as best practices, but also to prepare for the worst, namely attempted theft and even consider death.",
        "p3": "We will then experiment with the technology by sending and receiving money, using different wallets, on-chain and off-chain (Lightning Network), on a simulation network and on the real network (games, online stores). We will also use the blockchain to notarize a document (timestamping and signature). You will learn how to examine a transaction in a blockchain explorer. On this occasion we will address the issue of confidentiality.",

Participants will learn to interact with a Bitcoin node and perform different types of transactions. Starting with the simplest commands, we will gradually explore how to manually create more complex transactions.",
        "p2": "In a second step, we will work with the BitcoinJS library to compose various transactions in Javascript. We will create simple P2PKH transactions, used to send bitcoins to a person; data anchoring using the special OP_RETURN function; finally P2SH which lock bitcoins on an arbitrary smart-contract. We will have the opportunity to study Bitcoin's own smart-contract language, which allows us to build a multitude of smart-contracts such as algebraic equations, timelocks, cryptographic puzzles, multi-signatures and smart-contracts that mix all of this.",
        "p3": "At the end of this day, you will understand how a Bitcoin transaction works internally, how to read a raw transaction, how to interact with a node and retrieve various information, as well as manually create transactions and send them over the network. You will also discover the Bitcoin scripting language and what is possible to do with Bitcoin smart-contracts.",
        "p4": "Finally, please note that we will not spend too much time on the new Segwit transaction format as it requires already mastering Bitcoin programming and is by no means essential for this introductory course."

We will then test some Lapps (Lightning applications), which will also be an opportunity to present different Lightning wallets.",
        "p2": "After this introduction, we will move on to the practical workshop. We will install a local cluster of three LND nodes, all connected to a Bitcoin Core back-end in regtest. For this purpose we will have to establish payment channels. We will see how this is reflected on the blockchain. We will finally be able to make payments between these three nodes, directly (single hop) and indirectly (multi hops).",
        "p3": "In the second part of the training we will use Javascript. The first exercise will consist in making a submarine swap using BitcoinJS as well as LND from the command line. We will imagine a scenario where a user will pay a smart contract on-chain so that the latter will pay an off-chain merchant. This playful and instructive exercise should make us realized that the border between on-chain and off-chain is not so tight!",
        "p4": "We will then review some Javascript software libraries to interact with a LND node, as well as inspect the interface of the Nespresso capsule dispenser made by Bitcoin Studio. Before closing we will summarize the lessons of the day and discuss the latest developments."

  "About" : {
    "title": "ABOUT",
    "hero": "Bitcoin Studio has been founded by Stéphane Roche, Bitcoin and web developer, educator, consultant, maker and convinced cypherpunk.",
    "about-title": "Stéphane Roche - Founder",
    "about-content-1": "When I heard about Bitcoin in 2014, I quickly became obsessed. An alternative to the financial system was very appealing to me and I wanted to know more. I entered the rabbit hole and it completely changed my life.",
    "about-content-2": "A year and half before I was receiving my Master degree of History/Audiovisual documentalist. But I was already in love with Computer Science and just after the degree I was following evening courses to learn web development. That was the first bold move. It was not a comfortable situation but more a “succeed or die” situation, going back to the parental home at 28. Then for my end of web-dev studies internship in 2015 I applied to the French company Ledger and had the priviledge to work six months with a small and talented team where I learned a lot about Bitcoin and programming.",
    "about-content-3": "After which I worked a year as a Javascript developer in a fast growing startup called Anaplan, situated in the most exclusive district of Paris (16th arrondissement). It was a valuable experience, but end of 2016 I decided to go back to crypto-currencies. The strong corporate environnement and the rigid work hours were not for me. Also I could see the potential of “blockchain technology” (pun intented) when nobody around me knew what it was about. However, at the time I thought that focusing on Ethereum was the obvious choice in terms of business. I learnt how to create smart-contracts with Solidity, getting involved in different projects, co-founding Asseth, a now big non-profit association that promotes Ethereum in various ways. I was at the forefront, learning, programming and teaching Ethereum when it was still very early stage and unknown from the vast population.",
    "about-content-4": "The problem is that I couldn't find in Ethereum the values I was fighting for. I had a good position in the nascent industry, renowned in the small Ethereum French community that we created from the ground up. It was incomprehensible for everybody when I left Ethereum, right in the middle of the ICO craze. Yet another very bold move, that I don’t regret.",
    "about-content-5": "In September 2017 I moved to Lisbon to join a new crypto-friendly coworking space called The Block founded by a few French guys (including Kevin Loaec which organise Breaking Bitcoin and Building on Bitcoin), and I started to focus exclusively on Bitcoin. During two years I learned Bitcoin very thouroughly, studying all the different aspects of the technology and associated subjects like cryptography and game theory. I set myself the goal of doing Bitcoin technical presentations at the coworking every two months. The slides of each presentation is on my website.",
    "about-content-6": "During this time I made various educational projects, which was a very effective way for me to learn. I made an extensive guide that explains how to create all the different type of transaction with BitcoinJS, a virtual machine builder that includes all the Bitcoin softwares, a mnemonic template, a sort of game to teach how Bitcoin transaction works, etc. Everything is on the website and github. My last project is a Nespresso capsule vending machine that takes Bitcoin over Lightning Network. The machine has been made in a FabLab with a laser cutter and a 3D printer. It was the occasion to learn CAD, SBC programming with Lua, etc. Regarding the user interface, it comes in two versions. Customers can pay through a web application that I made, or through a BTCPay Point-of-Sale application. The machine is now in operation at The Block coworking.",
    "about-content-7": "To conclude I would say that I consider myself as an intermediate Javascript/Typescript Fullstack developer, with strong Bitcoin knowledge, and lot of other things that can’t fit in this bio. In March 2019 I founded the company Bitcoin Studio to offer Bitcoin software development and trainings. Over the years I think I gained enough experience to have the capacity to meet your needs."
