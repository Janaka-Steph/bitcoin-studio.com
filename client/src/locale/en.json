Bitcoin Core developers have a high level of expertise, the ecosystem is vast, has the largest market capitalization, and so on. Today, more than 75% of blockchains are, directly or indirectly, Bitcoin software forks. It is also the most attacked blockchain and consequently the most robust.",
      "p2": "Bitcoin is also a good start, as the protocol design is relatively simple, with a non-Turing-complete smart-contract feature. Finally, the new instant payment feature of the Lightning network is still offering new horizons."

        "title": "PROGRAMME",

        "p2": "We will install a real Bitcoin wallet, which will be an opportunity to learn to store digital assets in a secure way. You will not only learn how to create a backup as well as best practices, but also to prepare for the worst, namely attempted theft and even consider death.",
        "p3": "We will then experiment with the technology by sending and receiving money, using different wallets, on-chain and off-chain (Lightning Network), on a simulation network and on the real network (games, online stores). We will also use the blockchain to notarize a document (timestamping and signature). You will learn how to examine a transaction in a blockchain explorer. On this occasion we will address the issue of confidentiality.",

        "p1": "This training is technical and only accessible to people who are comfortable with computers, Javascript (beginner level) and the command line. It is strongly recommended that you first have a good understanding of Bitcoin, starting for example with the Mastering Bitcoin Fundamentals course.",
        "p2": "We will type Bash commands in a terminal and Javascript commands in a Node.js console. Bitcoin Core, Node.js, jq and a code editor will need to be installed on your computer. If you can not or do not want to configure this environment on your machine, you can download the <1>Virtual Box image</1> or use the <3>Vagrant box</3> that we provide, which includes all the required software. Also note that we are going to work in Regtest mode, which creates a fake local blockchain on the machine, so we do not need to download or sync a heavy blockchain."

        "title": "PROGRAMME",
        "p1": "To begin, we will recall the basics of how the blockchain works, the UTXO model and the smart-contracts system. We will then focus on Bitcoin Core and its API. Participants will learn to interact with a Bitcoin node and perform different types of transactions. Starting with the simplest commands, we will gradually explore how to manually create more complex transactions.",
        "p2": "In a second step, we will work with the BitcoinJS library to compose various transactions in Javascript. We will create simple P2PKH transactions, used to send bitcoins to a person; data anchoring using the special OP_RETURN function; finally P2SH which lock bitcoins on an arbitrary smart-contract. We will have the opportunity to study Bitcoin's own smart-contract language, which allows us to build a multitude of smart-contracts such as algebraic equations, timelocks, cryptographic puzzles, multi-signatures and smart-contracts that mix all of this.",
        "p3": "At the end of this day, you will understand how a Bitcoin transaction works internally, how to read a raw transaction, how to interact with a node and retrieve various information, as well as manually create transactions and send them over the network. You will also discover the Bitcoin scripting language and what is possible to do with Bitcoin smart-contracts.",
        "p4": "Finally, please note that we will not spend too much time on the new Segwit transaction format as it requires already mastering Bitcoin programming and is by no means essential for this introductory course."
