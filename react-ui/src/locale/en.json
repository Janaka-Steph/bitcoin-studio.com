      "p1": "If you plan to work anywhere in the blockchain industry, mastering Bitcoin is an essential skill. It is the first of its kind, which means the most attacked and therefore the most robust blockchain. Bitcoin Core developers are highly experienced, the ecosystem is big, has the biggest market capitalization, etc. More than 75% of the blockchains today are, directly or indirectly, software forks of Bitcoin.",
      "p2": "Bitcoin is also a great start because it has the simplest protocol design, with a non-Turing-complete smart-contract functionality. Finally, the new micropayment feature Lightning Network is bringing tremendous new business opportunities."

We will take time to explain each of this topic separately, and at the end you will be able to understand how they relate to each other and to get the bigger picture.",
        "p2": "We will set up a real Bitcoin wallet, which will be the occasion to teach you how to securely store digital assets. You will learn, not simply how to create a secure backup and the best practices, but really how to be prepared for the worst, namely attacks and death.",
        "p3": "Then we will experiment with the technology by sending and receiving money, using different wallets, on-chain and off-chain (Lightning Network), on a simulation network and on the real network (games, stores). We will also use the blockchain to notarized a document (timestamping and signing). You will learn how to examine a transaction in a blockchain explorer, and this will also be the occasion to raise awareness about privacy in Bitcoin.",
        "p4": "Lastly, mainly to raise your curiosity, the instructor will demo what you can do from the command line console integrated in the Bitcoin Core software."

        "p2": "We will type Bash commands in a terminal and Javascript commands in a Node.js console. You will need to have Bitcoin Core, Node.js, jq and a code editor installed on your machine. If you are not able or don't want to set up this environment on your machine you can download the <1>Ubuntu Virtual Machine image</1> that we provide, which includes all the required softwares.

Participants will install the software on their machine (or use the provided virtual machine), determine how to interact with a Bitcoin node and how to perform different kind of transactions. Starting with the simplest commands we will gradually explore how to create more complex transactions by hand, and by doing so learning a lot about Bitcoin.",
        "p2": "In a second time we will work with the BitcoinJS library to compose a variety of transactions in Javascript. We will create P2PKH transactions, used to send bitcoins to someone; data anchoring using a special type of transaction with OP_RETURN; P2SH, which consists of locking bitcoins to a custom smart contract. We will spend some time investigating how the Bitcoin scripting language works and the different building blocks that allows us to construct a variety of smart contracts like puzzles, timelocks, hashlocks and multi-signatures.",
        "p3": "At the end of this day, you will understand how Bitcoin transaction works internally, how to read a raw transaction, how to interact with a node, getting various information from it and sending transactions. You will also discover the Bitcoin scripting language and what is possible to do with Bitcoin smart contracts.",
        "p4": "Finally, note that we will not spend too much time on the new Segwit transaction format as it already requires to master Bitcoin programming and is in any way essential to understand Bitcoin."

The idea behind it is to have a document that gathers all the necessary information you need to be able to recover coins. In particular, it prompts the user to fill in the derivation path, assuming the user knows or will search for it. Having the right mnemonic code, but missing the derivation path does not permit coin recovery might make it very difficult to recover coins. Finally, this template got its inspiration from the reading of Pamela Morgan <1>Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning</1> book. Bitcoin owners should make sure that the funds are redeemable by their heirs in the eventuality of their death.<3></3><4>➱ Bitcoin Mnemonic Code Template</4>"

He has co-founded the french non-profit organization Asseth to promote Ethereum, now the biggest Ethereum non-profit across Europe and created the website <1>asseth.fr</1>. To develop his skills, he undertook research work on the Dao1901 dapp, using Web3 and state of the art Javascript libraries, to later be involved in the making of the <3>Dether.io</3> smart contracts and Javascript tests.",
    "about-content-2": "Since mid-2017, he is focusing uniquely on Bitcoin, building a solid expertise and now offering Bitcoin workshops and custom development. Coming from web development (and before that Archaeology, History and audiovisual archivist... yes it's a long story), Stéphane masters technologies like Typescript, Fusebox, React, Redux, Redux-sagas, etc. Over the years he gained a fair bit of experience on Bitcoin, blockchain technology, computer science, project management, and is capable of successfully bring your project to fruition in a timely manner."
